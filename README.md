  - The main idea is to use the light sensor and to get trusted results, this is needed to calibrate the app i.e the data of the sensor by comparing it with present methods to arrive at an algorithm. 
  - Then the mobile ambient light sensor(inbuilt) through which mobile adjusts its brightness in different environment can be used to measure the radiation intensity in watts/m2 or BTUh/ft2.
  - The app can provide full solar survey for chosen site, or sites, for any date or location once it has enough dataset
  - The required data can be searched from the database for a combination of latitude and longitude over a period of time to get idea of regionâ€™s potential as a energy resource.
